# CF_SQL_Rockbuster_Stealth
This project focused on using SQL to analyze the data of a fictional movie rental company (Rockbuster Stealth) in order to help them successfully launch their own streaming service. 

Of special importance were the following questions:
- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
- What was the average rental duration for all videos?
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

This has been achieved by exploring the inventory and revenues of the stores by using the relational database management system pgAdmin4 within the PostgreSQL. The findings have been communicated and visualized in Tableau.
